# Workshop of Web Development.


I didn't have much experience with web applications at all, so i became aware that the Rocketseat (https://rocketseat.com.br/) would make a free web development workshop for a week. Then i saw this as an opportunity to get started in the technology and decided to publishe the project of the workshop here, with my personal comments to share the things that i've learned.
